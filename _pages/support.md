# Support Chat Room

We have set up a dedicated support chat room for WeatherLink Real-time Data Feed users.

The chat room is monitored by the Davis Instruments/WeatherLink engineers responsible for the Real-time Data Feed. Feel free to ask your questions and report any issues you have with the Real-time Data Feed.

Keep in mind other people will also be in the chat room so please be careful and do not post any credentials or secrets in the chat.

The chat room is available at <a href="https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/real-time-data-feed">https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/real-time-data-feed</a>
